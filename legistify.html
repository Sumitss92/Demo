			<h2>GLOSSARY</h2>
			<ul class="glolist">
				<li id="one">
					<a href="" class="open">A</a>
					<div class="text">
						<h5>a fortiori</h5>
						<p>(ah-for-she-ory) prep. Latin for "with even stronger reason," which applies to a situation in which if one thing is true then it can be inferred that a second thing is even more certainly true. Thus, if Anil is too young to serve as administrator, then his younger brother Amit certainly is too young.</p>

						<h5>a priori assumption</h5>
						<p>(ah-pree-ory) n. from Latin, an assumption that is true without further proof or need to prove it. It is assumed the sun will come up tomorrow. However, it has a negative side: an a priori assumption made without question on the basis that no analysis or study is necessary, can be mental laziness when the reality is not so certain.</p>

						<h5>a.k.a.</h5>
						<p>prep. abbreviation for "also known as" when someone uses different initials, a nickname, a maiden or married name. Example: Amit G. Das, a.k.a. A. G. Das, a.k.a. &quot Snuffy the Snod.&quot </p>

						<h5>ab initio</h5>
						<p>prep. lawyer Latin for &quot from the start,&quot as &quotit was legal ab initio.&quot </p>

						<h5>abandon</h5>
						<p>v. to intentionally and permanently give up, surrender, leave, desert or relinquish all interest or ownership in property, a home or other premises, a right of way, and even a spouse, family, or children. The word is often used in situations to determine whether a tenant has left his/her apartment and the property inside and does not intend to come back. Thus, a landlord can take over an apparently abandoned residence, but must store anything a tenant leaves behind and give notice to the tenant before selling the possessions, which are left. To abandon children can mean to have no contact and give no support for a year or more. </p>

						<h5>abandoned property</h5>
						<p>n. property left behind (often by a tenant) intentionally and permanently when it appears that the former owner (or tenant) does not intend to come back, pick it up, or use it. Examples may include possessions left in a house after the tenant has moved out or autos left beside a road for a long period of time, or patent rights of an inventor who does not apply for a patent and lets others use his invention without protest. One may have abandoned the property of contract rights by not doing what is required by the contract. However, an easement and other land rights are not abandoned property just because of non-use. </p>

						<h5>bachelor of laws </h5>
						<p>n. the degree in law from a law school, abbreviated to LLB, which means that the recipient has successfully completed three years of law studies in addition to at least three undergraduate years on any subject. </p>

						<h5>back-to-back life sentences </h5>
						<p>n. for consecutive life terms imposed by a judge when there were two crimes committed by the defendant, both of which can result in punishment of a life term, such as two murders, or a murder and a rape involving aggravated assault. The purpose of making the sentences subsequent ("back-to-back") and not "concurrent" (served at the same time) is to lessen the chance of parole, since if parole were permissible after 25 years, the defendant would then begin the second "life" sentence and would wait another 25 years for a parole hearing.</p>

						<h5>bad debt</h5>
						<p>n. an uncollectible debt. The problem is to determine when a debt is realistically dead, which means there must be some evidence of uncollectibility or a lengthy passage of time. Discharge in bankruptcy, the running of the statute of limitations to bring a lawsuit, disappearance of the debtor, a pattern of avoiding debts or the destruction of the collateral security can all make a debt "bad." For income tax deduction purposes such a debt in business is deductible against ordinary income and such a personal debt is deductible against short-term capital gains. A debt due for services rendered is not a bad debt for tax purposes, since there is just no income on which to be taxed.</p>

						<h5>bad faith </h5>
						<p>1) n. intentional dishonest act by not fulfilling legal or contractual obligations, misleading another, entering into an agreement without the intention or means to fulfill it, or violating basic standards of honesty in dealing with others. 2) adj. when there is bad faith then a transaction is called a "bad faith" contract or "bad faith" offer.</p>

					<a href="" class="open">C</a>
					<div class="text">
						<h5>c.i.f.</h5>
						<p>n. the total of cost, insurance and freight charges to be paid on goods purchased and shipped.</p>

						<h5>calendar</h5>
						<p>1) n. the list of cases to be called for trial before a particular court; 2) v. to set and give a date and time for a case, petition or motion to be heard by a court. Usually a judge, a trial setting commissioner, or the clerk of the court calendars cases.</p>

						<h5>calendar call</h5>
						<p>n. the hearing at which a case is set for trial.</p>

						<h5>call</h5>
						<p>n. the demand by a corporation that a stockholder pay an installment or assessment on shares already owned</p>

						<h5>calumny </h5>
						<p>n. the intentional and generally vicious false accusation of a crime or other offense designed to damage one's reputation.</p>

						<h5>cancel</h5>
						<p>v. to cross out, annul, destroy, void and/or rescind a document. Cancelling can be done in several ways: tear up the document or mark on its face that it is cancelled, void, or terminated if the debt for which it stood has been paid. It is important that the document (like a promissory note) itself become no longer operative either by destruction or marking, so that it cannot be used again. </p>
